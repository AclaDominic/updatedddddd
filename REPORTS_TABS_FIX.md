# Reports Page Tabs Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Production Tabs Showing Same Content**
**Problem:** All 4 production tabs (Output Analytics, Resource Utilization, Cycle & Throughput, Predictive Analytics) were displaying the same "Work Progress by Stage" content.

**Root Cause:** Lines 1272-1322 contained a "Work Progress by Stage" section that was displayed unconditionally whenever `mainTab === "production"` was true, regardless of which sub-tab was selected.

**Fix:** Removed the unconditional content block (lines 1272-1322) so that only tab-specific content displays based on the `activeTab` state.

### 2. **Improved Error Handling for API Calls**
**Problem:** When any of the 6 advanced analytics endpoints failed, ALL endpoints would fail due to `Promise.all()` behavior.

**Changes Made:**
- Changed from `Promise.all()` to `Promise.allSettled()`
- Added individual error logging for each endpoint
- Added success logging with data preview
- Shows summary count of successful vs failed endpoints

**Benefits:**
- Failed endpoints no longer prevent successful ones from loading
- Clear visibility into which specific endpoint is failing
- Better debugging with detailed error messages

## Current Tab Structure

### Production Tabs
1. **Output Analytics** (`activeTab === "output-analytics"`)
   - Production output by product
   - Top performing products
   - Production trends charts

2. **Resource Utilization** (`activeTab === "resource-util"`)
   - Material usage by product
   - Material efficiency metrics

3. **Cycle & Throughput** (`activeTab === "cycle-throughput"`)
   - Cycle time analysis
   - Throughput metrics

4. **Predictive Analytics** (`activeTab === "predictive"`)
   - Material usage forecast
   - Production capacity forecast
   - Inventory replenishment needs

### Inventory Tabs
1. **Overview** (`activeTab === "overview"`)
2. **Inventory Status** (`activeTab === "inventory"`)
3. **Stock Report** (`activeTab === "stock-report"`)
   - Critical items
   - Low stock items
   - Healthy items
4. **Material Usage** (`activeTab === "material-usage"`)
   - Material usage trends by product
5. **Replenishment** (`activeTab === "replenishment"`)
6. **Forecast** (`activeTab === "forecast"`)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Refresh the page** to see the improved error logging
2. **Check the console** for:
   - ‚úÖ Success messages showing which endpoints loaded
   - ‚ùå Error messages showing which endpoints failed
   - üìä Summary count of successful loads
3. **Test Production Tabs:**
   - Click each tab and verify unique content displays
   - No duplicate "Work Progress by Stage" content
4. **Test Inventory Tabs:**
   - Verify Stock Report shows critical/low/healthy items
   - Verify Material Usage shows usage by product

## Console Output Example

```
‚úÖ Production Output loaded: {products: {...}, top_performing: [...]}
‚úÖ Resource Utilization loaded: {material_usage_by_product: [...]}
‚ùå Failed to load predictive: {message: "Request failed with status code 500"}
‚úÖ Stock Report loaded: {summary: {...}, items_by_status: {...}}
üìä Advanced analytics: 5/6 endpoints loaded successfully
```

## Next Steps

If any endpoints are still failing (showing ‚ùå in console):
1. Check the backend Laravel logs for the specific endpoint
2. Verify the database has the required data
3. Check the controller method for any errors
