# ✅ Time-Based Automatic Progress Updates

## What Was Implemented

Production progress now **automatically updates based on time elapsed** since production started!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Automatic Progress Calculation**:
```
Production Started: Day 1
    ↓
Time Passes (Days/Hours)
    ↓
System Calculates: Elapsed Time / Total Estimated Time
    ↓
Processes Automatically Update:
  - Pending → In Progress → Completed
    ↓
Overall Progress Updates: 0% → 50% → 100%
```

### **Example Timeline** (14-day production):
```
Day 1-2:   Material Preparation (10%) → Completed
Day 3-5:   Cutting & Shaping (20%) → Completed  
Day 6-9:   Assembly (30%) → Completed
Day 10-11: Sanding & Surface Prep (15%) → Completed
Day 12-14: Finishing (20%) → Completed
Day 14:    Quality Check (5%) → Completed
           → Overall: 100% ✅
```

## 📊 What Gets Updated Automatically

### **1. Process Status**:
- **Pending** → Changes to **In Progress** when time reaches process start
- **In Progress** → Changes to **Completed** when time reaches process end

### **2. Process Timestamps**:
- `started_at` → Set when process becomes in progress
- `completed_at` → Set when process completes

### **3. Production Progress**:
- `overall_progress` → Updates based on elapsed time percentage
- `current_stage` → Updates to current in-progress process name
- `status` → Updates to "Completed" when all processes done

### **4. Production Completion**:
- `actual_completion_date` → Set when 100% complete

## 🔄 When Updates Happen

### **Trigger Point**:
Every time you call `GET /api/productions`, the system:
1. Fetches all productions
2. Calculates time elapsed for each
3. Updates processes and progress
4. Returns updated data

### **Real-Time Updates**:
- **Customer View**: Shows current progress based on time
- **Admin View**: Shows current stage based on time
- **No Manual Updates Needed**: Everything automatic!

## 🧪 How to Demo

### **Step 1: Check Current Date**
```
Current Date: October 14, 2025
Production #1 Started: September 17, 2025
Days Elapsed: 27 days
Expected Duration: 14 days
Result: Should be 100% complete!
```

### **Step 2: View Productions**
1. Go to Productions page
2. System automatically calculates progress
3. Productions started 14+ days ago → 100%
4. Productions started 7 days ago → ~50%
5. Productions started 1 day ago → ~10%

### **Step 3: Change Device Date**
1. Change system date forward (e.g., +7 days)
2. Refresh Productions page
3. Progress automatically increases!
4. Processes automatically complete!

### **Step 4: Watch Progress Update**
```
Before: Production #2 at 25% (Cutting & Shaping)
Change date: +7 days
After: Production #2 at 75% (Finishing)
```

## 📝 Calculation Formula

### **Overall Progress**:
```
Elapsed Time = Now - Production Started At
Total Time = Estimated Completion - Production Started At

Progress % = (Elapsed Time / Total Time) × 100
```

### **Process Progress**:
```
Process 1: 0-10% of total time
Process 2: 10-30% of total time
Process 3: 30-60% of total time
Process 4: 60-75% of total time
Process 5: 75-95% of total time
Process 6: 95-100% of total time

If elapsed time >= process end time:
  → Process status = 'completed'
```

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Realistic Demo**: Progress updates based on actual time
2. **No Manual Updates**: Everything automatic
3. **Customer Satisfaction**: Accurate progress tracking
4. **Time-Based**: Matches real production timelines
5. **Auto-Complete**: Processes complete when time is reached

## 🎯 Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Production Started 14 Days Ago**
```
Started: September 17, 2025
Today: October 1, 2025
Elapsed: 14 days (100% of 14-day timeline)

Result:
✅ All 6 processes: Completed
✅ Overall progress: 100%
✅ Status: Completed
✅ Shows in "Ready to Deliver"
```

### **Scenario 2: Production Started 7 Days Ago**
```
Started: September 24, 2025
Today: October 1, 2025
Elapsed: 7 days (50% of 14-day timeline)

Result:
✅ Processes 1-3: Completed
✅ Process 4: In Progress
✅ Processes 5-6: Pending
✅ Overall progress: ~50%
✅ Status: In Progress
```

### **Scenario 3: Change Date Forward**
```
Before: October 1, 2025 (7 days elapsed)
Change to: October 8, 2025 (14 days elapsed)
Refresh page

Result:
✅ Progress jumps from 50% → 100%
✅ All processes complete
✅ Status: Completed
✅ Ready for delivery!
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Process Duration Distribution**:
```
Total: 14 days = 20,160 minutes

1. Material Preparation: 2,016 min (10%)
2. Cutting & Shaping: 4,032 min (20%)
3. Assembly: 6,048 min (30%)
4. Sanding & Surface Prep: 3,024 min (15%)
5. Finishing: 4,032 min (20%)
6. Quality Check: 1,008 min (5%)
```

### **Update Logic**:
```php
$elapsedMinutes = now()->diffInMinutes($production->production_started_at);
$totalMinutes = $production->estimated_completion_date->diffInMinutes($production->production_started_at);

$progress = ($elapsedMinutes / $totalMinutes) * 100;

// Cap at 100%
if ($progress > 100) $progress = 100;
```
