## 🔍 How to Verify It's Fixed

### Method 1: Run Verification Script
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=VerifyOrderData
```

**Look for:**
```
✅ All checks passed!
   - All pending orders have NO production (correct)
   - All accepted orders have production (correct)

=== Production Tracking Page (What Admin Sees) ===
Productions shown: 8
  🏭 Production #1  | Order #3  | ...
  🏭 Production #2  | Order #4  | ...
  ...
  🏭 Production #8  | Order #10 | Alkansya | Progress: 50%
```

### Method 2: Check in Browser

**Customer Orders Page:**
- Login: `customer@gmail.com` / `password`
- Should see: 10 orders (all of them)

**Production Tracking Page:**
- Login: `admin@gmail.com` / `password`
- Should see: 8 productions (orders 3-10 only)

## 🛠️ Controllers Updated

Both production controllers now filter to only show accepted orders:

### ProductionTrackingController.php
```php
->whereHas('order', function($q) {
    $q->where('acceptance_status', 'accepted');
});
```

### ProductionController.php
```php
->whereHas('order', function($q) {
    $q->where('acceptance_status', 'accepted');
});
```

## 📊 Expected Data After Fix

## 🔄 Workflow Explanation

### Order Lifecycle

```
1. Customer places order
   ↓
2. Order created with acceptance_status = 'pending'
   ↓
3. NO Production record created yet
   ↓
4. Customer sees order in "My Orders" (pending)
   ↓
5. Admin does NOT see it in production tracking
   ↓
6. Admin accepts the order
   ↓
7. acceptance_status changed to 'accepted'
   ↓
8. Production record created
   ↓
9. Admin NOW sees it in production tracking
   ↓
10. Customer sees progress updates
```

### Why This Is Correct

- **Pending orders** = Customer placed but admin hasn't accepted yet
  - Should show in customer orders ✅
  - Should NOT show in production ✅

- **Accepted orders** = Admin accepted and production started
  - Should show in customer orders ✅
  - Should show in production ✅
