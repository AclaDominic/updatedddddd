## Difference Between Tabs

### "Ready To Deliver" vs "Completed Productions"

| Feature | Ready To Deliver | Completed Productions |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| Shows | Only items ready but not yet marked | ALL completed items |
| Filter | status='Completed' AND order status NOT 'ready'/'delivered' | status='Completed' |
| Purpose | Action needed - mark as ready | Historical view of all completions |
| Order Status | Only 'processing' | All statuses (processing, ready, delivered) |
| Use Case | Daily workflow - what needs delivery | Historical tracking & reporting |

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Track All Completions
View all completed Table and Chair productions regardless of delivery status.

### Use Case 2: Historical Reference

### Use Case 3: Mark Orders Ready

### Use Case 4: Mark Orders Delivered
For completed productions that are ready, use the "Mark Delivered" button.

### Use Case 5: Verify Completion Dates
See actual completion dates vs estimated dates for performance tracking.
