  - Historical usage patterns (past 60 days)
  - Product-material relationships from seeders

### **3. Enhanced Reports Page** ✅
- **6 Tabs** with comprehensive analytics:
  1. 📦 **Inventory Status** - Stock levels, status distribution, reorder needs
  2. 📅 **Replenishment** - Original replenishment report with forecast
  3. 🔄 **Stock Turnover** - Fast/medium/slow moving items with charts
  4. 📈 **Consumption Trends** - Usage patterns and trend analysis
  5. 🎯 **ABC Analysis** - Value-based classification (A/B/C items)
  6. 🏭 **Production Reports** - Link to production analytics

### **4. Visual Enhancements** ✅
- Summary cards showing key metrics
- Interactive charts (Pie, Bar, Line)
- Color-coded status indicators
- Responsive design

## 🔄 How Materials Are Consumed

### **Based on Seeder Data**:

1. **Production Creates Usage**:
   - When a product is produced (from `CustomerOrdersSeeder`)
   - System looks up BOM (`ProductMaterialsSeeder`)
   - Calculates material consumption: `qty_per_unit × production_quantity`
   - Records usage in `inventory_usages` table

2. **Example - Dining Table Production**:
   ```
   Product: Dining Table (1 unit)
   Materials consumed:
   - HW-2x6x8 (Hardwood): 4 pieces
   - HW-1x8x10 (Hardwood): 6 pieces
   - PLY-18-4x8 (Plywood): 1 sheet
   - WS-3 (Screws): 32 pieces
   - WG-250 (Glue): 1 bottle
   - SAND-80 (Sandpaper): 4 sheets
   - SAND-120 (Sandpaper): 6 sheets
   - VARN-1L (Varnish): 0.5 liter
   ```

3. **Historical Data**:
   - Past 60 days of usage patterns
   - Varying consumption rates
   - Realistic trends for forecasting

---

## 📈 Analytics Features

### **Real Data from Seeders**:
- ✅ 432 usage records created
- ✅ 17 records from actual production
- ✅ 415 historical records for trends
- ✅ Based on 3 products (Dining Table, Wooden Chair, Alkansya)
- ✅ Tracks 31 inventory items

### **Calculations**:
- **Average Daily Usage**: Total usage ÷ days in period
- **Days Until Stockout**: Current stock ÷ avg daily usage
- **Turnover Rate**: Total usage ÷ avg stock level
- **Trend Analysis**: Linear regression on daily usage
- **ABC Classification**: Pareto analysis (80-15-5 rule)
