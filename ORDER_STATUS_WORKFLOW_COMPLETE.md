# Order Status Workflow - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a proper order status workflow that ensures orders follow the correct lifecycle from checkout to delivery.

## Order Status Flow

### 1. **Pending** (After Checkout)
- **When**: Customer completes checkout
- **What happens**:
  - Order is created with `status = 'pending'`
  - Order has `acceptance_status = 'pending'`
  - OrderTracking is created with `status = 'pending'`
  - **NO production records are created yet**
  - Inventory materials are deducted at checkout

### 2. **Processing** (After Order Acceptance)
- **When**: Admin accepts the order via Order Acceptance page
- **What happens**:
  - Order `status` changes to `'processing'`
  - Order `acceptance_status` changes to `'accepted'`
  - Production records are created for each item
  - OrderTracking `status` changes to `'in_production'`
  - Production starts with first process (Material Preparation)
  - Customer receives notification that order is in production

### 3. **Ready for Delivery** (After Production Completion)
- **When**: Production stage reaches "Ready for Delivery" or "Completed"
- **What happens**:
  - Order `status` changes to `'ready_for_delivery'`
  - Production `status` is set to `'Completed'`
  - Production `overall_progress` is set to 100%
  - OrderTracking `status` changes to `'ready_for_delivery'`
  - OrderTracking `progress_percentage` is set to 100
  - Customer receives notification that order is ready

### 4. **Delivered** (Manual Update by Admin)
- **When**: Admin marks order as delivered
- **What happens**:
  - Order `status` changes to `'delivered'`
  - Customer receives delivery confirmation notification

### 5. **Completed** (Final State)
- **When**: Admin marks order as completed (after delivery confirmation)
- **What happens**:
  - Order `status` changes to `'completed'`
  - Customer receives completion notification

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **ProductionController.php** (Lines 300-320)
```php
// Update order status to 'ready_for_delivery' when production is done
if ($production->order_id) {
    $order = Order::find($production->order_id);
    if ($order && $order->status === 'processing') {
        $order->status = 'ready_for_delivery';
        $order->save();
        
        // Update order tracking status
        OrderTracking::where('order_id', $order->id)->update([
            'status' => 'ready_for_delivery',
            'current_stage' => 'Ready for Delivery',
            'progress_percentage' => 100,
        ]);
    }
}
```

#### 2. **OrderController.php** (Line 689)
- Added `'processing'` to allowed status values in validation
- Added notification handling for `'processing'` status change

#### 3. **OrderAcceptanceController.php** (Lines 124-129, 183)
- Already correctly sets `status = 'processing'` when order is accepted
- Sets OrderTracking `status = 'in_production'` when production starts

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **OrderTable.js** (Customer Orders Page)
- Added acceptance status display section showing:
  - "Pending acceptance" for orders awaiting admin approval
  - "Accepted and in production" for accepted orders
  - Rejection reason if order was rejected
- Updated status steps to include: Pending → Processing → Ready for Delivery → Delivered
- Production tracking only shows for accepted orders

#### 2. **EnhancedOrdersManagement.js** (Admin Orders Page)
- Added "Processing" status option with primary color and ⚙️ icon
- Updated status descriptions:
  - Pending: "Order is awaiting acceptance"
  - Processing: "Order is accepted and in production"
  - Ready for Delivery: "Order is ready to be delivered"
  - Delivered: "Order has been delivered to customer"
  - Completed: "Order is fully completed"

## Database Schema

### Orders Table Status Values
```sql
ENUM('pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'ready_for_delivery', 'delivered', 'cancelled')
```

### Orders Table Acceptance Status
```sql
ENUM('pending', 'accepted', 'rejected')
```

### OrderTracking Status Values
```sql
status: 'pending', 'in_production', 'ready_for_delivery', 'completed'
```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. CHECKOUT
   ├─> Order created (status: 'pending', acceptance_status: 'pending')
   ├─> OrderTracking created (status: 'pending')
   ├─> Inventory deducted
   └─> NO production records yet

2. ADMIN ACCEPTS ORDER
   ├─> Order status: 'pending' → 'processing'
   ├─> Order acceptance_status: 'pending' → 'accepted'
   ├─> Production records created
   ├─> OrderTracking status: 'pending' → 'in_production'
   └─> Customer notified: "Order in production"

3. PRODUCTION COMPLETES
   ├─> Production stage: → 'Ready for Delivery'
   ├─> Production status: → 'Completed'
   ├─> Order status: 'processing' → 'ready_for_delivery'
   ├─> OrderTracking status: 'in_production' → 'ready_for_delivery'
   └─> Customer notified: "Order ready for delivery"

4. ADMIN MARKS AS DELIVERED
   ├─> Order status: 'ready_for_delivery' → 'delivered'
   └─> Customer notified: "Order delivered"

5. ADMIN MARKS AS COMPLETED
   ├─> Order status: 'delivered' → 'completed'
   └─> Customer notified: "Order completed"
```

- Production page only shows accepted orders

### ✅ Automatic Updates
- Order status automatically changes to 'processing' when accepted
- Order status automatically changes to 'ready_for_delivery' when production completes

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create new order via checkout
- [ ] Verify order shows as "pending" on customer orders page
- [ ] Verify order shows in "Pending Orders" on admin acceptance page
- [ ] Accept order via admin panel
- [ ] Verify order status changes to "processing"
- [ ] Verify production records are created
- [ ] Verify customer sees "accepted and in production" message
- [ ] Update production stage to "Ready for Delivery"
- [ ] Verify order status changes to "ready_for_delivery"
- [ ] Verify customer sees updated status
- [ ] Mark order as "delivered" via admin
- [ ] Verify customer receives delivery notification
- [ ] Mark order as "completed"
- [ ] Verify final status on both admin and customer pages

## Notes

- **Inventory Deduction**: Happens at checkout, NOT at order acceptance
- **Production Creation**: Happens at order acceptance, NOT at checkout
- **Status Validation**: Backend validates all status transitions
- **Tracking Sync**: OrderTracking automatically syncs with Production progress
- **Alkansya Products**: Instantly marked as ready for delivery (pre-made inventory)
- **Custom Products**: Follow full production workflow (2 weeks estimated)

## Migration Status

✅ Migration `2025_10_01_000000_add_processing_status_to_orders.php` already exists and adds 'processing' to the status enum.

## Conclusion

The order status workflow is now properly implemented with:
1. ✅ Orders stay pending until accepted
2. ✅ Orders change to processing when accepted and production starts
3. ✅ Orders change to ready_for_delivery when production completes
4. ✅ Clear visibility for both customers and admins
5. ✅ Automatic status updates based on production progress
6. ✅ Proper notifications at each stage
