## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Production Tracking" shows for pending orders
**Solution**: Already fixed in OrderTable.js
- Check: `order.acceptance_status === 'accepted'` condition is present

### Issue: Order stays "processing" after marking "Ready for Delivery"
**Solution**: Already fixed in ProductionController.php
- Check: Order status auto-updates when production reaches "Ready for Delivery"

### Issue: Migration error "Data truncated"
**Solution**: Already fixed in migration
- The down() method now updates 'processing' to 'pending' before removing from enum

### Issue: Pending orders showing in Production Dashboard
**Solution**: This is correct behavior
- Production Dashboard should only show accepted orders (4, 5, 6, 7)
- Pending orders (1, 2, 3) should NOT appear

## Verification Commands

### Check Order Statuses
```bash
php check_productions.php
```

### Check Database Directly
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> Order::all(['id', 'status', 'acceptance_status'])->toArray();
>>> Production::all(['id', 'order_id', 'status', 'overall_progress'])->toArray();
```

### Re-run Migration (if needed)
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **All tests pass**
✅ **Pending orders (1-3)**: Show "Pending" only, no production tracking
✅ **Processing orders (4-6)**: Show "Processing" with production tracking
✅ **Completed order (7)**: Show "Completed" with 100% progress
✅ **Order acceptance**: Creates production and changes status to "processing"
✅ **Production completion**: Auto-updates order status to "completed"

## Final Notes

- The system is now fully functional with proper status flow
- All automatic updates are working correctly
- Frontend display matches backend data
