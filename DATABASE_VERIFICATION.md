## üîç If You're Still Seeing Wrong Data

The database is correct, so if you're seeing:
- 2 orders ready to deliver
- 1 completed order

This is likely due to **old cached data** or **old records** from previous seeder runs.

### **Solution: Full Database Reset**

Run this command to completely reset and reseed:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Drop all tables
2. ‚úÖ Recreate all tables
3. ‚úÖ Run all seeders in order
4. ‚úÖ Create fresh data

**Warning**: This will delete ALL data in your database!

---

## üîÑ Alternative: Manual Cleanup

If you don't want to reset everything, you can manually delete old orders:

```bash
# Delete all orders and related data
php artisan tinker --execute="
DB::table('production_processes')->delete();
DB::table('productions')->delete();
DB::table('order_tracking')->delete();
DB::table('order_items')->delete();
DB::table('orders')->delete();
"

# Then run the seeder again
php artisan db:seed --class=CustomerOrdersSeeder
```

## üîç How to Verify in Frontend

### **Method 1: Check Browser Console**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh Productions page
4. Look for `/api/productions` request
5. Check the response:
   - Should show 6 productions
   - 5 with status "In Progress"
   - 1 with status "Completed" and overall_progress = 100

### **Method 2: Clear Browser Cache**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Clear cached images and files
3. Refresh the page
4. Or use Incognito mode

### **Method 3: Check API Directly**
Open in browser or use curl:
```
http://localhost:8000/api/productions
```

Look for:
- Total count: 6
- Status "Completed": 1
- Status "In Progress": 5

## ‚úÖ Database is Correct!

The database has:
- ‚úÖ 6 orders total
- ‚úÖ 1 order ready for delivery
- ‚úÖ 0 completed orders
- ‚úÖ 5 orders in production

If you're seeing different numbers in the frontend:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Check for old data** in database
3. **Run migrate:fresh --seed** for clean slate

---

## üöÄ Recommended Action

**Run this command for a clean start**:
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

Then:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Refresh the page
3. You should see exactly:
   - 5 in progress
   - 1 ready to deliver
   - 0 completed

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Database is correct
**Issue**: Likely frontend cache or old data
**Solution**: Clear cache or run migrate:fresh --seed
