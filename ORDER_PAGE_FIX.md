# Order Page Fix - Show All Orders by Default

## Issue
The UnifiedOrderManagement component was only displaying pending orders when the page loaded, instead of showing all orders.

## Root Cause
The `activeView` state was initialized to `'pending'` instead of `'all'`, which caused the filter to only show pending orders on initial load.

```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong)
const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState('pending');
```

## Solution
Changed the default `activeView` to `'all'` so all orders are displayed by default.

```javascript
// AFTER (Correct)
const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState('all');
```

## Changes Made

### File: `UnifiedOrderManagement.jsx`

**Line 30:**
```javascript
const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState('all'); // pending, all, accepted, rejected
```

**Line 106:**
Added comment to clarify the filter logic:
```javascript
// If activeView is 'all', don't filter by acceptance status
```

## How It Works Now

### Default View (All Orders)
When the page loads:
- âœ… Shows **ALL orders** (pending, accepted, rejected)
- âœ… Statistics cards show correct counts
- âœ… Users can click cards to filter by category

### Filter Logic
```javascript
if (activeView === 'pending') {
  // Show only pending orders
} else if (activeView === 'accepted') {
  // Show only accepted orders
} else if (activeView === 'rejected') {
  // Show only rejected orders
}
// If activeView is 'all', show all orders (no filter applied)
```

### User Experience

**On Page Load:**
1. All orders are displayed in the table
2. Statistics cards show counts for each category
3. "All Orders" card is highlighted (border)

**Clicking Statistics Cards:**
- Click "Pending Acceptance" â†’ Shows only pending orders
- Click "Accepted" â†’ Shows only accepted orders
- Click "Rejected" â†’ Shows only rejected orders
- Click "All Orders" â†’ Shows all orders again

## Verification

After the fix:

### âœ… Page Load
- All orders display in the table
- Total count matches "All Orders" card
- No filters are applied by default

### âœ… Statistics Cards
- Each card shows correct count
- Clicking a card filters orders
- "All Orders" card is highlighted by default

### âœ… Filters Still Work
- Search box filters across all orders
- Status dropdown filters correctly
- Payment method filter works
- Date range filter works
- Clicking statistics cards quick-filters
