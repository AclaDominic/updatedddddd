# Order Status Flow - Complete Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the order status display to show **Pending → Processing → Completed** in the Status Tracker.

## Status Flow

### Before Acceptance
```
Order Status: pending
Acceptance Status: pending
Display: ⏱ Pending → ○ Processing → ○ Completed
Production: None
```

### After Acceptance (Production Starting)
```
Order Status: processing
Acceptance Status: accepted
Display: ✓ Pending → ⏱ Processing → ○ Completed
Production: Created, Status = 'In Progress', Progress = 0%
```

### During Production
```
Order Status: processing
Acceptance Status: accepted
Display: ✓ Pending → ⏱ Processing → ○ Completed
Production: Status = 'In Progress', Progress = 43-93%
```

### Production Completed
```
Order Status: completed
Acceptance Status: accepted
Display: ✓ Pending → ✓ Processing → ⏱ Completed
Production: Status = 'Completed', Progress = 100%
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
**File**: `2025_10_01_000000_add_processing_status_to_orders.php`

Added 'processing' to the orders status enum:
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders MODIFY COLUMN status 
ENUM('pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'ready_for_delivery', 'delivered', 'cancelled') 
DEFAULT 'pending'
```

### 2. Order Acceptance Controller
**File**: `OrderAcceptanceController.php`

When admin accepts an order:
```php
$order->update([
    'acceptance_status' => 'accepted',
    'status' => 'processing', // Changed from 'pending'
]);
```

### 3. Production Controller
**File**: `ProductionController.php`

When production is completed:
```php
if ($normalizedStage === 'Completed') {
    $production->status = 'Completed';
    $production->overall_progress = 100;
    
    // Auto-update order status
    if ($production->order_id) {
        $order = Order::find($production->order_id);
        $order->status = 'completed';
        $order->save();
    }
}
```

### 4. Customer Orders Seeder
**File**: `CustomerOrdersSeeder.php`

Updated `createTimeAccurateOrder()` method:
```php
// Determine order status based on progress
$orderStatus = 'pending';
if ($isCompleted || $progress >= 100) {
    $orderStatus = 'completed'; // 100% = completed
} elseif ($progress > 0) {
    $orderStatus = 'processing'; // In progress = processing
}
```

## Seeder Data After Fix

| Order | Product | Placed | Accepted | Progress | Order Status | Display |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|----------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Dining Table | Today | Not yet | 0% | **pending** | ⏱ Pending |
| 2 | Wooden Chair | Yesterday | Not yet | 0% | **pending** | ⏱ Pending |
| 3 | Alkansya | 2d ago | Not yet | 0% | **pending** | ⏱ Pending |
| 4 | Dining Table | 14d ago | 13d ago | 93% | **processing** | ⏱ Processing |
| 5 | Wooden Chair | 10d ago | 9d ago | 64% | **processing** | ⏱ Processing |
| 6 | Dining Table | 7d ago | 6d ago | 43% | **processing** | ⏱ Processing |
| 7 | Wooden Chair | 16d ago | 15d ago | 100% | **completed** | ⏱ Completed |

## Status Tracker Display

The frontend `OrderTable.js` component shows:
```javascript
const steps = ["Pending", "Processing", "Completed"];
```

### Icons:
- ✓ **Completed step**: Green checkmark
- ⏱ **Current step**: Yellow clock
- ○ **Future step**: Gray box

### Example Displays:

**Order #1 (Pending)**
```
⏱ Pending  ○ Processing  ○ Completed
```

**Order #4 (Processing - 93%)**
```
✓ Pending  ⏱ Processing  ○ Completed
```

**Order #7 (Completed - 100%)**
```
✓ Pending  ✓ Processing  ⏱ Completed
```

## Production Dashboard

### Ready for Delivery Section
Orders with `status = 'completed'` and `production.status = 'Completed'` will appear in the "Ready for Delivery" dashboard.

**Query**:
```php
$readyOrders = Order::where('status', 'completed')
    ->whereHas('productions', function($q) {
        $q->where('status', 'Completed')
          ->where('overall_progress', 100);
    })
    ->get();
```

## Automatic Status Updates

### When Order is Accepted
```
1. Admin clicks "Accept Order"
2. Order status → 'processing'
3. Production created with 0% progress
4. Tracking status → 'in_production'
5. Status Tracker shows: ✓ Pending → ⏱ Processing
```

### When Production Completes
```
1. Admin marks production as "Completed" or "Ready for Delivery"
2. Production status → 'Completed'
3. Production progress → 100%
4. Order status → 'completed' (automatic)
5. Status Tracker shows: ✓ Pending → ✓ Processing → ⏱ Completed
6. Order appears in "Ready for Delivery" dashboard
```

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Run Migration
```bash
cd capstone-back
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 2: Refresh Database
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Step 3: Verify Order Statuses
```bash
php test_orders.php
```

Expected output:
```
Orders by status:
  - pending: 3
  - processing: 3
  - completed: 1
```

### Step 4: Check Frontend Display

**Pending Orders (1-3)**:
- Status Tracker: ⏱ Pending
- No production tracking shown
- "Waiting for acceptance" message

**Processing Orders (4-6)**:
- Status Tracker: ✓ Pending → ⏱ Processing
- Production progress bar showing 43%, 64%, 93%
- Current stage displayed

**Completed Orders (7)**:
- Status Tracker: ✓ Pending → ✓ Processing → ⏱ Completed
- Progress: 100%
- "Ready for delivery" message

### Step 5: Test Order Acceptance
1. Login as admin
2. Accept Order #1
3. Verify:
   - Order status changes to 'processing'
   - Status Tracker shows: ✓ Pending → ⏱ Processing
   - Production created with 0% progress

### Step 6: Test Production Completion
1. Go to Production Dashboard
2. Mark a production as "Completed"
3. Verify:
   - Production status = 'Completed'
   - Order status = 'completed' (automatic)
   - Status Tracker shows: ✓ Pending → ✓ Processing → ⏱ Completed
   - Order appears in "Ready for Delivery"

## Summary

✅ **Order status now matches Status Tracker display**
✅ **Pending orders show "Pending" status**
✅ **Accepted orders show "Processing" status**
✅ **Completed orders show "Completed" status**
✅ **Production completion auto-updates order status**
✅ **Completed orders appear in "Ready for Delivery" dashboard**
✅ **Seeder creates accurate time-based data**
✅ **Status Tracker icons match order state**

All three status values (pending, processing, completed) now work correctly throughout the system!
