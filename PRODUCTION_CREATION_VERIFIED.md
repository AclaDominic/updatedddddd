## ✅ **Production IS Being Created!**

When you accept an order:

2. ✅ 6 Production processes created
3. ✅ All processes set to "pending" status
4. ✅ Production status set to "Pending"
5. ✅ Current stage set to "Material Preparation"

---

## 🔍 How to Verify

### **Method 1: Check Database Directly**
```bash
cd capstone-back
php check_productions.php
```

### **Method 2: Check via SQL**
```sql
-- Find accepted orders
SELECT id, acceptance_status, accepted_at 
FROM orders 
WHERE acceptance_status = 'accepted';

-- Check productions for that order
SELECT id, order_id, product_name, status, current_stage 
FROM productions 
WHERE order_id = 6;

-- Check processes
SELECT id, production_id, process_name, process_order, status 
FROM production_processes 
WHERE production_id = 36
ORDER BY process_order;
```

### **Method 3: Check Productions Page**
1. Go to `/productions`
2. Look for Production #36
3. Should show:
   - Product: Wooden Chair
   - Status: Pending
   - Stage: Material Preparation
   - 6 processes attached

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### **Backend**:
1. ✅ Added `processes` relationship to Production index query
2. ✅ Added comprehensive logging
3. ✅ Verified production creation logic works
4. ✅ Confirmed 6 processes are created for tables/chairs

### **The Issue**:
The productions WERE being created, but the frontend might not have been showing them properly because:
- The `processes` relationship wasn't being loaded
- Or the page needed a refresh

When you call `GET /api/productions`, you now get:

```json

  {
    "id": 36,

    "product_name": "Wooden Chair",
