# Accurate Orders Seeder - Fixed for Production Display

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Productions Not Showing in Production Tracking Page**
**Problem**: Orders with `acceptance_status = 'accepted'` were creating productions, but they weren't displaying in the production tracking page.

**Root Cause**: 
- Orders with 0% progress were being created, which might not display properly
- Production processes weren't being set to 'in_progress' correctly for newly accepted orders
- The seeder wasn't ensuring minimum progress for accepted orders

**Solution**:
- Changed Order 3 from 0% to 5% progress (minimum for accepted orders)
- Added `actualProgress = max(5, progress)` to ensure all accepted orders have at least 5% progress
- Fixed production process status logic to properly set first process as 'in_progress'
- Added `progress_percentage` field to OrderTracking

### 2. **Production Processes Not Showing Correct Status**
**Problem**: Production processes for accepted orders were all showing as 'pending' instead of having the first process as 'in_progress'.

**Root Cause**: The process creation logic didn't properly handle the case where an order is just accepted (progress > 0 but still in first stage).

**Solution**:
```php
elseif ($index === $currentStageIndex || ($progress > 0 && $index === 0 && $currentStageIndex === 0)) {
    // Current process is in progress (or first process if just started)
    $processStatus = 'in_progress';
    $startedAt = $productionStartedAt->copy()->addDays($cumulativeDays);
}
```

### 3. **Tracking Status Not Syncing with Production**
**Problem**: OrderTracking status wasn't properly reflecting production status.

**Solution**:
- Added `progress_percentage` field to tracking creation
- Ensured tracking status is 'in_production' for all accepted orders (except 100% complete)
- Set `actual_start_date` for all accepted orders

## Changes Made

### AccurateOrdersSeeder.php

#### 1. Minimum Progress for Accepted Orders (Lines 225-226)
```php
// Ensure minimum progress of 5% for accepted orders to show in production tracking
$actualProgress = max(5, $progress);
```

#### 2. Order 3 Progress Updated (Line 88)
```php
// Changed from 0% to 5%
'progress' => 5,
```

#### 3. Production Progress Uses Actual Progress (Line 244)
```php
'overall_progress' => $actualProgress,
```

#### 4. Tracking Progress Added (Lines 256, 272)
```php
$actualProgress = $isAccepted ? max(5, $progress) : 0;
// ...
'progress_percentage' => $actualProgress,
```

#### 5. Improved Process Status Logic (Lines 380-389)
```php
elseif ($index === $currentStageIndex || ($progress > 0 && $index === 0 && $currentStageIndex === 0)) {
    // Current process is in progress (or first process if just started)
    $processStatus = 'in_progress';
    $startedAt = $productionStartedAt->copy()->addDays($cumulativeDays);
} elseif ($index < $currentStageIndex) {
    // Previous processes should be completed
    $processStatus = 'completed';
    $startedAt = $productionStartedAt->copy()->addDays($cumulativeDays);
    $completedAt = $startedAt->copy()->addDays($proc['days_duration']);
}
```

#### 6. Enhanced Logging (Lines 293-308)
```php
$displayProgress = $isAccepted ? max(5, $progress) : 0;
// Shows actual progress used and production status
```

## Expected Results After Running Seeder

### Orders Created (10 Total)

#### Pending Orders (2)
- **Order 1**: Dining Table - Just placed, awaiting acceptance
- **Order 2**: Wooden Chair - Placed 2 days ago, awaiting acceptance
- ❌ **No productions created** for these orders
- ❌ **Will NOT show** in production tracking page

#### Processing Orders (7)
- **Order 3**: Dining Table - 5% complete (just accepted)
- **Order 4**: Wooden Chair - 15% complete
- **Order 5**: Dining Table - 35% complete
- **Order 6**: Wooden Chair - 55% complete
- **Order 7**: Dining Table - 80% complete

- **Order 10**: Alkansya - 50% complete
- ✅ **Productions created** for all these orders
- ✅ **Will show** in production tracking page
- ✅ **First process is 'in_progress'** for each production

#### Ready for Delivery (1)
- **Order 9**: Dining Table - 100% complete
- ✅ **Production created** and marked as 'Completed'
- ✅ **Will show** in production tracking page

### Production Tracking Page Display

The production tracking page will show **8 productions** (Orders 3-10):

```
Production #1 - Dining Table (Order #3)
├─ Status: In Progress
├─ Progress: 5%
├─ Stage: Material Preparation
└─ Process: Material Preparation (in_progress) ✅

Production #2 - Wooden Chair (Order #4)
├─ Status: In Progress
├─ Progress: 15%
├─ Stage: Material Preparation
└─ Process: Material Preparation (in_progress) ✅

Production #3 - Dining Table (Order #5)
├─ Status: In Progress
├─ Progress: 35%
├─ Stage: Cutting & Shaping
└─ Process: Cutting & Shaping (in_progress) ✅

... and so on for orders 6-10
```

### Customer Orders Page Display

The customer orders page will show **ALL 10 orders**:

```
Order #1 - PENDING
├─ Acceptance Status: ⏳ Pending
└─ Message: "Your order is pending acceptance by our team"

Order #2 - PENDING
├─ Acceptance Status: ⏳ Pending
└─ Message: "Your order is pending acceptance by our team"

Order #3 - PROCESSING
├─ Acceptance Status: ✅ Accepted
├─ Progress: 5%
└─ Message: "Your order has been accepted and is now in production!"

... and so on for orders 4-10
```

## How to Run the Seeder

### Option 1: Run Only This Seeder
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=AccurateOrdersSeeder
```

### Option 2: Refresh Database and Run All Seeders
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Option 3: Run from DatabaseSeeder
Make sure `AccurateOrdersSeeder` is called in `DatabaseSeeder.php`:
```php
$this->call([
    ProductsTableSeeder::class,
    AccurateOrdersSeeder::class,
]);
```

## Verification Checklist

After running the seeder, verify:

- [ ] **Admin Production Page**: Shows 8 productions (Orders 3-10)
- [ ] **Admin Production Page**: Each production shows correct progress (5%, 15%, 35%, etc.)
- [ ] **Admin Production Page**: First process is 'in_progress' for each production
- [ ] **Admin Production Page**: Does NOT show Orders 1-2 (pending orders)
- [ ] **Customer Orders Page**: Shows all 10 orders
- [ ] **Customer Orders Page**: Orders 1-2 show "Pending acceptance" message
- [ ] **Customer Orders Page**: Orders 3-10 show "Accepted and in production" message
- [ ] **Customer Orders Page**: Production tracking only visible for Orders 3-10
- [ ] **Order Tracking**: Progress bars show correct percentages
- [ ] **Order Tracking**: Current stage matches progress percentage

## Key Improvements

1. ✅ **Minimum Progress**: All accepted orders have at least 5% progress
2. ✅ **Process Status**: First process is always 'in_progress' for accepted orders
3. ✅ **Tracking Sync**: OrderTracking properly syncs with Production
4. ✅ **Clear Separation**: Pending orders don't create productions
5. ✅ **Accurate Display**: Both admin and customer pages show correct data
6. ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Progress percentage is stored and displayed correctly
7. ✅ **Status Flow**: Orders follow proper lifecycle (pending → processing → ready_for_delivery)

## Notes

- **Inventory**: The seeder doesn't deduct inventory. If you need inventory tracking, ensure products have sufficient stock or disable inventory checks.
- **Production Tracking Service**: The seeder calls `ProductionTrackingService::syncOrderTrackingWithProduction()` to ensure data consistency.
- **Time-Based Progress**: The seeder uses static progress values. In production, progress would be calculated based on time elapsed.
- **Alkansya Products**: Treated as special case with simplified stages but still follow the same workflow.

## Troubleshooting

### Productions Not Showing?
1. Check that `acceptance_status = 'accepted'` in orders table
2. Verify productions exist in database: `SELECT * FROM productions WHERE order_id IN (3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)`
3. Check ProductionController index method filters: `whereHas('order', function($q) { $q->where('acceptance_status', 'accepted'); })`

### Progress Not Displaying?
1. Verify `overall_progress` field in productions table
2. Check `progress_percentage` field in order_tracking table
3. Ensure values are >= 5 for accepted orders

### Processes All Pending?
1. Check production_processes table: `SELECT * FROM production_processes WHERE production_id = X`
2. Verify at least one process has `status = 'in_progress'`
3. Check `started_at` is not null for in_progress processes
