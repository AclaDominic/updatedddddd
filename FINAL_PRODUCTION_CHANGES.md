      )}

      {/* Ready to Deliver Tab */}

## How to Apply Manually

3. Copy the "Find" text exactly as shown
4. Copy the "Replace" text exactly as shown
5. Click "Replace" for each change
6. Save the file

## Expected Result

After applying these changes, you should have:

- ✅ Tab navigation at the top
- ✅ "Current Production Processes" tab (default)
- ✅ "Ready to Deliver" tab
- ✅ Order filter dropdown in Current tab
- ✅ Full-width display for productions
- ✅ Each tab shows/hides correctly

## Testing

1. Refresh the page
2. Click "Current Production Processes" tab - should show productions
3. Click "Ready to Deliver" tab - should show completed items
4. Use order filter - should filter by selected order
5. Check boxes should still work to mark stages complete

## Current Status

The page now has:
- Tab structure in place
- Order filtering working
- Full-width layout for better visibility
- All stage descriptions and durations showing

Only 2 small closing tag adjustments needed to complete the reorganization!
