# Quick Testing Guide - Order Status Workflow

## Step 1: Reset Database and Run Seeders

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd capstone-back

# Reset database and run all seeders
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## Step 2: Verify Seeder Output

You should see output like:
```
=== Creating Accurate Orders with Synchronized Tracking ===

1. Creating PENDING order (just placed, awaiting admin acceptance)
   ‚úì Order #1 | Dining Table x1
     Order Status: pending | Acceptance: ‚è≥ PENDING
     üè≠ Production: NOT CREATED (order not accepted)
        Will show in production tracking: NO ‚ùå

3. Creating PROCESSING order (just accepted today, production starting)
   ‚úì Order #3 | Dining Table x1
     Order Status: processing | Acceptance: ‚úÖ ACCEPTED
     üè≠ Production: #1 CREATED
        Stage: Material Preparation | Progress: 5%
        Status: In Progress | Will show in production tracking: YES ‚úÖ
```

## Step 3: Test Customer Orders Page

### Access
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/orders` (or your customer orders route)
- Login as: `customer@gmail.com` / `password`

### Expected Results
‚úÖ **Should see 10 orders total**

**Pending Orders (2):**
- Order #1, #2
- Badge: Yellow "Pending"
- Message: "Your order is pending acceptance by our team"
- ‚ùå No production tracking visible

**Processing Orders (7):**
- Order #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #10
- Badge: Blue "Processing"
- Message: "Your order has been accepted and is now in production!"
- ‚úÖ Production tracking visible with progress bars

**Ready for Delivery (1):**
- Order #9
- Badge: Info "Ready for Delivery"
- Progress: 100%

## Step 4: Test Admin Production Page

### Access
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/admin/production` (or your production route)
- Login as: `admin@gmail.com` / `password`

### Expected Results
‚úÖ **Should see 8 productions** (Orders 3-10 only)

**Each production should show:**
- Production ID
- Product name
- Order ID
- Current stage
- Progress percentage (5%, 15%, 35%, 55%, 80%, 95%, 50%, 100%)
- Status: "In Progress" or "Completed"
- At least one process with status "in_progress"

‚ùå **Should NOT see:**
- Order #1 (pending)
- Order #2 (pending)

## Step 5: Test Admin Orders Page

### Access
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/admin/orders`
- Login as: `admin@gmail.com` / `password`

### Expected Results
‚úÖ **Should see all 10 orders**

**Status Distribution:**
- 2 orders: Status "Pending" (yellow badge)
- 7 orders: Status "Processing" (blue badge)
- 1 order: Status "Ready for Delivery" (info badge)

**Can change status:**
- Click "Change Status" button
- Should see options: Pending, Processing, Ready for Delivery, Delivered, Completed, Cancelled

## Step 6: Test Order Acceptance Page

### Access
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/admin/order-acceptance`
- Login as: `admin@gmail.com` / `password`

### Expected Results
‚úÖ **Should see 2 pending orders** (Orders #1 and #2)

**Test Accepting an Order:**
1. Click "Accept" on Order #1
2. Order should move to "Accepted" tab
3. Production should be created
4. Order status should change to "processing"
5. Go to Production page ‚Üí should now see new production
6. Go to Customer orders ‚Üí order should show "accepted and in production"

## Step 7: Test Production Progress Update

### Access Production Page
1. Find a production (e.g., Production #1 from Order #3)
2. Click "Update Stage" or similar button
3. Change stage to next stage (e.g., "Cutting & Shaping")
4. Save changes

### Expected Results
‚úÖ **Production updates:**
- Current stage changes
- Progress percentage increases
- Previous process marked as "completed"
- New process marked as "in_progress"

‚úÖ **Order tracking updates:**
- Customer sees updated stage
- Progress bar reflects new percentage

## Step 8: Test Production Completion

### Mark Production as Complete
1. Go to Production page
2. Find a production
3. Update stage to "Ready for Delivery"
4. Save changes

### Expected Results
‚úÖ **Production:**
- Status: "Completed"
- Progress: 100%
- All processes: "completed"

‚úÖ **Order:**
- Status changes to "ready_for_delivery"
- Customer sees "Order Ready for Delivery" badge

‚úÖ **Tracking:**
- Status: "ready_for_delivery"
- Progress: 100%

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Productions not showing in production page
**Solution:** 
- Check order `acceptance_status` is 'accepted'
- Verify production records exist in database
- Check ProductionController filters

### Issue: All processes showing as "pending"
**Solution:**
- Re-run seeder: `php artisan db:seed --class=AccurateOrdersSeeder`
- Check production_processes table for `status = 'in_progress'`

### Issue: Progress showing as 0%
**Solution:**
- Seeder now ensures minimum 5% for accepted orders
- Check `overall_progress` in productions table
- Check `progress_percentage` in order_tracking table

### Issue: Customer can't see production tracking
**Solution:**
- Verify order `acceptance_status = 'accepted'`
- Check OrderTracking record exists
- Verify frontend shows tracking only for accepted orders

## Quick Database Queries

### Check Orders
```sql
SELECT id, status, acceptance_status, accepted_at 
FROM orders 
ORDER BY id;
```

### Check Productions
```sql
SELECT p.id, p.order_id, p.product_name, p.current_stage, 
       p.status, p.overall_progress, o.acceptance_status
FROM productions p
JOIN orders o ON p.order_id = o.id
ORDER BY p.id;
```

### Check Production Processes
```sql
SELECT pp.production_id, pp.process_name, pp.status, pp.started_at
FROM production_processes pp
WHERE pp.production_id = 1
ORDER BY pp.process_order;
```

### Check Order Tracking
```sql
SELECT ot.order_id, ot.current_stage, ot.status, 
       ot.progress_percentage, o.acceptance_status
FROM order_tracking ot
JOIN orders o ON ot.order_id = o.id
ORDER BY ot.order_id;
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All 10 orders created
‚úÖ 2 orders pending (no productions)
‚úÖ 8 orders accepted (productions created)
‚úÖ Production page shows 8 productions
‚úÖ Customer orders page shows all 10 orders
‚úÖ Pending orders show "awaiting acceptance"
‚úÖ Accepted orders show production tracking
‚úÖ Progress bars display correctly

‚úÖ Order status updates when production completes
‚úÖ Notifications sent at each stage

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run the seeder
2. ‚úÖ Verify all pages display correctly
