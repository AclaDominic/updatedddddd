# ✅ Fixes Applied - Production Dashboard

## Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: 500 Error - Syntax Error**
**Problem**: Syntax error at line 612 in ProductionController.php  
**Cause**: Missing closing brace `}` and broken docblock comment  
**Solution**: Fixed the syntax by adding proper closing brace and docblock

### **Issue 2: Automatic Order Status Update**
**Problem**: User doesn't want orders automatically updated to "ready_for_delivery"  
**Solution**: Removed automatic order status update. Now productions at 100% just show as "Completed" in the productions list, and admin can manually mark them as ready for delivery.

---

## ✅ Current Behavior

### **When Production Reaches 100%**:
```
Production Progress: 100%
    ↓
Production Status: "Completed"
    ↓
Shows in Productions List as "Completed"
    ↓
Admin manually marks as "Ready for Delivery" when needed
```

### **No Automatic Order Update**:
- Production at 100% does NOT automatically change order status
- Order stays in current status until admin manually updates it
- Admin has full control over when to mark order ready for delivery

## 📊 Production Dashboard

### **Status Filters**:
- **All**: Shows all productions
- **In Progress**: Shows productions being worked on

### **Completed Productions**:
