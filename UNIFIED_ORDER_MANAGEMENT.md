## Components Breakdown

### Main Component: UnifiedOrderManagement.jsx

**State Management:**
- `orders`: All orders from API
- `filteredOrders`: Orders after applying filters
- `activeView`: Current view (pending/accepted/rejected/all)
- `selectedOrder`: Order selected for action
- `filters`: Search and filter criteria
- `stats`: Order statistics

**Key Functions:**
- `fetchOrders()`: Load all orders from API
- `applyFilters()`: Apply filters to orders
- `handleAcceptOrder()`: Accept pending order
- `handleRejectOrder()`: Reject pending order
- `handleUpdateStatus()`: Update order status

**UI Sections:**
1. Header with back button and refresh
2. Statistics cards (clickable filters)
3. Filter bar (search, status, payment, dates)
4. Orders table with actions
5. Modals for details, accept, reject, status update

## Customization

### Change Colors
Edit the gradient in the header:
```javascript
style={{ background: "linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)" }}
```

### Add More Filters
Add to the filters state and UI:
```javascript
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  search: '',
  status: '',
  paymentMethod: '',
  // Add your custom filter here
  customFilter: ''
});
```

### Modify Statistics
Update the stats calculation in `fetchOrders()`:
```javascript
const statistics = {
  pending: ordersData.filter(o => o.acceptance_status === 'pending').length,
  // Add your custom stat here
  customStat: ordersData.filter(o => /* your condition */).length
};
```

## Migration from Old Components

### Before (2 separate pages):
```javascript
// Order Acceptance Page
<Route path="/order-acceptance" element={<OrderAcceptance />} />

// Orders Management Page
<Route path="/orders" element={<OrdersPage />} />
```

### After (1 unified page):
```javascript
// Unified Order Management
<Route path="/orders" element={<OrdersPage />} />
// OrderPage.jsx now uses UnifiedOrderManagement
```

### Optional: Keep Old Components
The old components are still available if needed:
- `EnhancedOrdersManagement.js` - Original orders management
- `OrderAcceptance.jsx` - Original order acceptance

## Troubleshooting
