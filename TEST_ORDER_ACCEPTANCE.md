## 🧪 How to Test

### **Step 1: Check Logs**
Open Laravel log file:
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### **Step 2: Accept an Order**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Order Acceptance page
3. Click "Accept Order" on a pending order
4. Click "Accept Order" in the modal

### **Step 3: Watch the Logs**
You should see:
```
[timestamp] Accepting order #X
[timestamp] Order #X status updated to accepted
[timestamp] Creating production for product: Dining Table, isAlkansya: no
[timestamp] Production #Y created successfully
[timestamp] Creating 6 production processes for production #Y
[timestamp] Production processes created
[timestamp] Committing transaction for order #X
[timestamp] Transaction committed successfully
[timestamp] Total productions created for order #X: 1
```

### **Step 4: Check Frontend Alert**
You should see:
```
Order accepted successfully! 1 production record(s) have been created.
```

### **Step 5: Verify in Database**
```sql
-- Check order status
SELECT id, acceptance_status, accepted_by, accepted_at 
FROM orders 
WHERE id = X;

-- Check production created
SELECT id, order_id, product_name, current_stage, status 
FROM productions 
WHERE order_id = X;

-- Check production processes
SELECT id, production_id, process_name, process_order, status 
FROM production_processes 
WHERE production_id = Y
ORDER BY process_order;
```

### **Step 6: Check Productions Page**
1. Go to Productions page (/productions)
2. You should see the newly created production
3. Status: "Pending"
4. Stage: "Material Preparation"

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If No Productions Are Created**

1. **Check Laravel Logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```
   Look for error messages

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for error messages
   - Check the response from accept endpoint

3. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   -- Check if order status changed
   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = X;
   
   -- Check if any productions exist
   SELECT * FROM productions WHERE order_id = X;
   ```

4. **Common Issues**:
   - **Transaction rollback**: Check logs for exceptions
   - **Missing product**: Verify order has items with products
   - **Permission issue**: Ensure logged in as admin
   - **Database constraint**: Check for foreign key errors

## 📊 Expected Results

### **For Table/Chair Orders**:
```
✅ Order acceptance_status = 'accepted'
✅ Order accepted_by = admin_id
✅ Order accepted_at = timestamp
✅ Production created with:
   - status = 'Pending'
   - current_stage = 'Material Preparation'
   - requires_tracking = true
   - product_type = 'table' or 'chair'
✅ 6 Production processes created:
   1. Material Preparation (pending)
   2. Cutting & Shaping (pending)
   3. Assembly (pending)
   4. Sanding & Surface Preparation (pending)
   5. Finishing (pending)
   6. Quality Check & Packaging (pending)
✅ OrderTracking updated with status = 'pending'
```

### **For Alkansya Orders**:
```
✅ Order acceptance_status = 'accepted'
✅ Production created with:
   - status = 'Completed'
   - current_stage = 'Ready for Delivery'
   - requires_tracking = false
   - product_type = 'alkansya'
✅ NO production processes (alkansya is pre-made)
✅ OrderTracking updated
```

## 🎯 Quick Verification Commands

### **Count Productions for Order**:
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="echo Production::where('order_id', 1)->count();"
```

### **List Productions for Order**:
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="Production::where('order_id', 1)->get(['id', 'product_name', 'status', 'current_stage'])->each(fn(\$p) => print_r(\$p->toArray()));"
```

### **Count Production Processes**:
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="echo ProductionProcess::whereIn('production_id', Production::where('order_id', 1)->pluck('id'))->count();"
```
