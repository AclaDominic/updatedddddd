# Quick Start: Accurate Orders Seeder

## 🚀 Run This Seeder in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Clear Old Data (REQUIRED for clean results)
```bash
cd capstone-back
php artisan migrate:fresh
```
**Important:** This clears old data that might show pending orders in production.

### Step 2: Seed Products First
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=ProductsTableSeeder
```

### Step 3: Run the Accurate Orders Seeder
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=AccurateOrdersSeeder
```

**Note:** Controllers have been updated to filter out non-accepted orders from production tracking.

## ✅ What You'll Get

**10 Sample Orders:**
- 2 Pending orders (not accepted yet)
- 8 Accepted orders at various production stages (0%, 15%, 35%, 55%, 80%, 95%, 100%)
- Mix of Dining Tables, Wooden Chairs, and Alkansya products

## 🔍 How to Verify It Works

### Customer View
1. Login: `customer@gmail.com` / `password`
2. Go to "My Orders" page
3. Expand any order
4. Check: Progress bar shows accurate percentage
5. Check: Production stage matches progress

### Admin/Production View
1. Login: `admin@gmail.com` / `password`
2. Go to "Production Tracking" dashboard
3. Check: Same orders appear with same progress
4. Check: Current stage matches customer view
5. Filter by status - verify counts are correct

## 📝 Comparison with Old Seeder

### Old Seeder (CustomerOrdersSeeder)
❌ Time-based progress calculations (inconsistent)  
❌ Different stage names between Production and Tracking  
❌ Sync issues between systems  
❌ Progress didn't match stages  

### New Seeder (AccurateOrdersSeeder)
✅ Explicit progress control (consistent)  
✅ Identical stage names everywhere  
✅ Proper synchronization built-in  
✅ Progress perfectly matches stages  

## 🎓 Understanding the Data

### Order Lifecycle
```
PENDING → PROCESSING → READY FOR DELIVERY
   ↓           ↓              ↓
Not yet    Production    Production
accepted   in progress   complete
```

### Production Stages (Custom Furniture - 14 days)
```
Material Preparation (0-10%)
    ↓
Cutting & Shaping (10-30%)
    ↓
Assembly (30-60%)
    ↓
Sanding & Surface Prep (60-75%)
    ↓
Finishing (75-95%)
    ↓
Quality Check & Packaging (95-100%)
```

### Production Stages (Alkansya - 7 days)
**Note:** Uses same stage names as custom furniture for consistency
```
Material Preparation (0-16%)
    ↓
Cutting & Shaping (16-50%)
    ↓
Assembly (50-66%)
    ↓
Finishing (66-83%)
    ↓
Quality Check & Packaging (83-100%)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Run this seeder fresh** - Don't mix with old CustomerOrdersSeeder data
2. **Check both views** - Always verify customer and admin pages match
3. **Use filters** - Test filtering by status, product type, etc.
4. **Expand details** - Click on orders to see full tracking timeline
5. **Monitor sync** - Watch console logs during seeding for sync confirmations

## 🔄 Re-running the Seeder

If you need to reset and re-run:

```bash
# Full reset
php artisan migrate:fresh
php artisan db:seed --class=ProductsTableSeeder
php artisan db:seed --class=AccurateOrdersSeeder

# Or just clear orders (keeps products)
php artisan db:seed --class=AccurateOrdersSeeder --force
```
