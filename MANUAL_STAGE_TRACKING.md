# Manual Stage Tracking Implementation

## Overview
Converted the production tracking system from **automatic time-based progress** to **manual stage tracking** where admin and staff can manually mark each production stage as complete.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`capstone-back`)

#### 1. ProductionController.php

**Removed Automatic Time-Based Progress:**
- Removed the call to `updateTimeBasedProgress()` in the `index()` method (line 48)
- The system no longer automatically updates process status based on elapsed time
- Processes now remain in their current state until manually updated

**Added Manual Process Update Endpoint:**
- New method: `updateProcess($request, $productionId, $processId)` (lines 401-470)
- Route: `PATCH /api/productions/{productionId}/processes/{processId}`
- Accepts: `{ "status": "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed" }`
- Automatically updates timestamps (`started_at`, `completed_at`)
- Updates production's current stage based on process statuses
- Notifies customers when stages change
- Broadcasts real-time updates via Pusher

**Added Helper Method:**
- New method: `updateProductionStageFromProcesses($production)` (lines 472-522)
- Automatically determines production's current stage based on process statuses
- Updates overall progress percentage
- Marks production as completed when all processes are done
- Updates order status to 'ready_for_delivery' when production completes

### Frontend Changes (`casptone-front`)

#### 1. ProductionPage.jsx

**Updated UI for Manual Tracking:**
- Replaced automatic progress bars with interactive checkboxes (lines 599-652)
- Each production stage now shows:
  - ✅ Checkbox to mark as complete/incomplete
  - Stage name with strikethrough when completed
  - Estimated duration display
  - Status badge (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
  - Start and completion timestamps
  - Estimated delivery note: **2 weeks from production start**

**Added Process Update Handler:**
- New function: `handleProcessStatusChange(productionId, processId, isCompleted)` (lines 374-402)
- Calls the backend API to update process status
- Refreshes production data and analytics after update
- Shows success/error alerts to user
- Handles errors gracefully with UI revert

## Features

### For Admin & Staff:
1. **Manual Control**: Check/uncheck boxes to mark stages as done
2. **Real-time Updates**: Changes broadcast to all connected users
3. **Customer Notifications**: Customers receive notifications when stages change
4. **Progress Tracking**: Overall progress calculated from completed stages
5. **Timestamp Recording**: Automatically records when stages start/complete
6. **Flexible Workflow**: Can mark stages in any order (not strictly sequential)

### Estimated Delivery:
- **Tables**: 2 weeks from production start
- **Chairs**: 2 weeks from production start
- Displayed in the UI below the stage checklist

## API Endpoint

### Update Process Status
```http
PATCH /api/productions/{productionId}/processes/{processId}
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

{
  "status": "completed"  // or "pending" or "in_progress"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Process updated successfully",
  "process": { ... },
  "production": { ... }
}
```

## Production Stages

The system tracks these stages for each production:
1. Material Preparation
2. Cutting & Shaping
3. Assembly
4. Sanding & Surface Preparation
5. Finishing
6. Quality Check & Packaging

When all stages are completed:
- Production status → "Completed"
- Production stage → "Completed"
- Order status → "ready_for_delivery"
- Overall progress → 100%

## User Roles

Both **admin (employee)** and **staff** can:
- View production processes
- Mark stages as complete/incomplete
- See real-time updates
- Track progress manually

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: No longer tied to rigid time estimates
2. **Accuracy**: Reflects actual production status
3. **Control**: Staff can update progress as work happens
4. **Transparency**: Clear visual indication of what's done
5. **Simplicity**: Easy checkbox interface
6. **Real-time**: Instant updates across all users

## Testing

To test the manual tracking:
1. Log in as admin or staff
2. Navigate to Productions page
3. Find an "In Progress" production
4. Check/uncheck stage checkboxes
5. Observe:
   - Stage status updates
   - Current stage changes
   - Overall progress updates
   - Completion when all stages done
