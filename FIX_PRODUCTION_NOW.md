# Fix Production Display Issues NOW

## 🚨 Quick Fix - Run This Command

Open your terminal in the project root and run:

```bash
cd capstone-back
php artisan db:seed --class=CleanupAndReseedOrders
```

This will:
1. ✅ Delete all old order data
2. ✅ Reseed with accurate data
3. ✅ Verify everything is correct
4. ✅ Show you a summary

## What This Fixes

### Before (WRONG):
- ❌ Orders 1 & 2 (pending) showing in production
- ❌ Orders 7 & 10 (processing) NOT showing in production

### After (CORRECT):
- ✅ Orders 1 & 2 (pending) NOT in production
- ✅ Orders 3-10 (accepted/processing) ALL in production

## Expected Output

```

## Technical Details

### What the Cleanup Seeder Does

1. **Disables foreign key checks** - Allows truncating tables with relationships
2. **Truncates tables** - Removes all data from:
   - orders
   - order_items
   - order_tracking
   - productions
   - production_processes
3. **Re-enables foreign key checks** - Restores database integrity
4. **Calls AccurateOrdersSeeder** - Creates fresh, accurate data
5. **Verifies results** - Checks that data is correct

### Why This Works

The `AccurateOrdersSeeder` only creates Production records when `is_accepted` is true:

```php
// Only create production if accepted
if ($isAccepted) {
    $production = Production::create([...]);
}
```

Plus, the controllers filter to only show accepted orders:

```php
->whereHas('order', function($q) {
    $q->where('acceptance_status', 'accepted');
});
```

## Summary

✅ **One command fixes everything**  
✅ **Cleans up old data**  
✅ **Reseeds with accurate data**  
✅ **Verifies correctness**  
✅ **Orders 1 & 2 hidden from production**  
✅ **Orders 7 & 10 now showing in production**
