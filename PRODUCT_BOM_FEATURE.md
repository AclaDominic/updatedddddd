# Product BOM (Bill of Materials) Feature - Multi-Select Design

## Overview
Added an intuitive Bill of Materials functionality with **multi-select capability** to the product creation modal, allowing admins to select multiple materials at once and define quantities needed to produce each product.

## Changes Made

### Frontend: `ProductPage.jsx`

#### New State Variables
- `inventoryItems` - Stores all available inventory items
- `bomItems` - Stores the BOM entries for the new product
- `showMaterialSelector` - Controls visibility of the multi-select material picker
- `selectedMaterials` - Tracks which materials are selected in the picker

#### New Functions
1. **`fetchInventoryItems()`** - Fetches all inventory items from the API when modal opens
2. **`handleAddBomItem()`** - Opens the multi-select material picker
3. **`handleMaterialToggle(materialId)`** - Toggles selection of a material (checkbox)
4. **`handleConfirmMaterials()`** - Adds all selected materials to BOM with default quantity of 1
5. **`handleRemoveBomItem(index)`** - Removes a BOM entry by index
6. **`handleBomItemChange(index, field, value)`** - Updates quantity for a specific BOM entry
7. **`getInventoryItemName(id)`** - Returns formatted name for display

#### Updated Functions
- **`handleAddProduct()`** - Single-step process:
  - Validates product details
  - Filters valid BOM items (ignores incomplete entries)
  - Saves product and BOM in one action

#### UI Enhancements
- **Modal Size**: Large (`size="lg"`) for comfortable viewing
- **Scrollable Body**: `maxHeight: '70vh'` with overflow scroll
- **Inline Layout**: Product details and BOM in one continuous form
- **Card-Based BOM Items**: Each material in its own card for clarity
- **Responsive Grid**: Price and Stock side-by-side on larger screens

#### BOM Section Features (Always Visible)
- **Section Header**: "ðŸ“¦ Materials Needed (BOM)" with "+ Add Materials" button
- **Multi-Select Picker**: Checkbox-based material selector with:
  - Scrollable list of all inventory items
  - Two-column layout for easy scanning
  - Real-time counter showing selected count
  - Cancel and Confirm buttons
- **Material Table**: All added materials shown in a clean table with:
  - Material name column (bold text with SKU and unit below)
  - Quantity per unit column (editable numeric input)
  - Action column (trash icon to remove)
- **Multiple Materials**: Select and add multiple materials at once
- **Default Quantity**: All materials start with quantity of 1

## User Flow

1. Click "Add Product" button
2. Fill in product details:
   - Product Name (required)
   - Price and Stock (required, side-by-side)
   - Description (optional)
   - Image URL (optional)
3. Scroll to "Materials Needed (BOM)" section (always visible)
4. Click "+ Add Materials" button
5. **Multi-Select Picker appears**:
   - Check multiple materials you need
   - See count update in real-time
   - Click "Add X Materials" to confirm
6. **Edit quantities**:
   - Each material appears as a card with quantity = 1
   - Update quantities as needed
   - Remove any material with trash icon
7. Click "Save Product" - saves everything at once
8. Success message shows how many materials were added

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /inventory` - Fetch all inventory items
- `POST /products` - Create new product
- `POST /products/{id}/materials` - Save BOM for product

### Data Format
```javascript
{
  items: [
    {
      inventory_item_id: 1,
      qty_per_unit: 5
    },
    // ... more items
  ]
}
```

## Validation
- Product name, price, and stock are required
- BOM entries must have both material and quantity selected
- Quantity must be greater than 0
- Empty BOM entries must be removed before saving

## Benefits
1. **Better Inventory Management**: Links products to required materials
2. **Production Planning**: Automatically calculates material needs
3. **Cost Tracking**: Enables accurate product cost calculation
4. **User-Friendly**: Two-step process prevents overwhelming users
5. **Flexible**: BOM is optional - can skip if not needed
