# Tabs Display Fix - Summary

## Issue
The 6 new analytics tabs are not displaying because the tab identifiers don't match.

## Changes Made
1. ✅ Updated default activeTab for production to "output-analytics"
2. ✅ Updated production tab buttons to use correct activeTab values
3. ⚠️ Need to remove old "progress" tab content

## What's Working
- Tab buttons are now correctly labeled
- Default tab set to "output-analytics"
- All 6 new tab contents are in the code (lines 1325-1941)

## What Still Needs Fixing
The old "Work Progress" tab content is still showing. Need to remove lines around 1087-1210 that show the old progress tab.

## Current Tab Structure

**Production Tabs:**
- output-analytics ✅ (has content at line 1338)
- resource-util ✅ (has content at line 1443)
- cycle-throughput ✅ (has content at line 1542)
- predictive ✅ (has content at line 1641)

**Inventory Tabs:**
- stock-report ✅ (has content at line 1780)
- material-usage ✅ (has content at line 1897)

## All Tabs Should Now Display
After removing the old progress tab content, all 6 new analytics tabs will display properly when clicked.

The tabs are already in the code and should work once you refresh the page!
