# How to See the Enhanced Reports Dashboard

## Issue
Your browser is showing a cached version of the Reports page. The enhanced dashboard with tabs, charts, and export features has been successfully implemented in the code, but your browser needs to refresh to show the new version.

## Solutions (Try in Order)

### Solution 1: Hard Refresh (Fastest)
1. Open the Reports page in your browser
2. Press one of these key combinations:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
3. This will force the browser to reload without using cached files

### Solution 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools:
   - Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
2. Right-click on the refresh button (while DevTools is open)
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Solution 3: Clear All Cache (Most Thorough)

#### For Chrome/Edge:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Choose "All time" from the time range
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Refresh the page

#### For Firefox:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cache"
3. Choose "Everything" from the time range
4. Click "Clear Now"
5. Refresh the page

### Solution 4: Restart Development Server
If you're running the React development server:

1. Stop the server (Ctrl + C in the terminal)
2. Start it again:
   ```bash
   cd casptone-front
   npm start
   ```
3. Wait for it to compile
4. Open the page in your browser

### Solution 5: Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open a new Incognito/Private window
2. Navigate to your application
3. Log in and go to the Reports page
4. This bypasses all cache

## What You Should See

After clearing the cache, the Reports page should display:

### Header Section
- Back to Dashboard button
- Title: "ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Reports & Analytics"
- Summary cards showing:
  - Total Items
  - Low Stock Items
  - Out of Stock
  - Recent Usage (7d)

### Navigation Tabs (8 tabs)
1. ðŸ“Š Overview
2. ðŸ“¦ Inventory Status
3. ðŸ“… Replenishment
4. ðŸ”„ Stock Turnover
5. ðŸ”® Forecast
6. ðŸ“ˆ Trends
7. ðŸŽ¯ ABC Analysis
8. ðŸ“… Daily Usage (NEW)

### Features on Each Tab
- **Export CSV button** (ðŸ“¥ Export CSV) on the top right of each report

3. Look for **pie charts and bar charts** in the reports
4. The "Daily Usage" tab should be visible

## Still Not Working?

If you still see the old table view after trying all solutions:

1. Check the browser console for errors (F12 â†’ Console tab)
2. Verify the file was saved: Check the timestamp of `Report.jsx`
3. Make sure you're on the correct URL: `/reports` (not `/inventory-reports`)
4. Try a different browser
5. Restart your computer (clears all system cache)
