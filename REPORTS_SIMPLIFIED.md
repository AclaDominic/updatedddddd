# Reports Page Simplified - Focused on Core Objectives

## ✂️ Changes Made

### **Removed Features** (Not in Core Objectives):
1. ❌ **Stock Turnover Report** - Fast/Medium/Slow moving analysis
2. ❌ **ABC Analysis Report** - Value-based classification (A/B/C)

### **Kept Features** (Aligned with Objectives):
1. ✅ **Overview** - Dashboard summary and critical items
2. ✅ **Inventory Status** - Current stock levels and usage rates
3. ✅ **Replenishment** - Automated reorder scheduling
4. ✅ **Forecast** - Material usage predictions (30 days)
5. ✅ **Trends** - Consumption patterns over time
6. ✅ **Daily Usage** - Date-specific material tracking

## 🎯 Why These Were Removed

### **Stock Turnover Analysis**
- **Not in Objectives**: Your objectives focus on stock level monitoring and predictive analytics, not turnover velocity analysis
- **Adds Complexity**: Extra charts and calculations not required for thesis
- **Not Essential**: Fast/medium/slow classification doesn't support your core goals

### **ABC Analysis**
- **Not in Objectives**: Value-based classification (A/B/C) is not mentioned in any of your 3 main objectives
- **Beyond Scope**: This is an advanced inventory technique not required for your system
- **Not Necessary**: Your system already tracks what matters - stock levels, usage, and forecasts
