## Time-Based Progress Calculation

The seeder uses smart date calculation to work WITH the time-based progress system:

```php
if ($progress >= 100) {
    // Completed: both dates in past
    $estimatedStart = now()->subDays($totalProductionDays + 1);
    $estimatedCompletion = now()->subDays(1);
} elseif ($progress > 0) {
    // In progress: calculate start date for desired progress
    $targetElapsedDays = ($progress / 100) * $totalProductionDays;
    $estimatedStart = now()->subDays($targetElapsedDays);
    $estimatedCompletion = $estimatedStart->copy()->addDays($totalProductionDays);
} else {
    // Not started: start today
    $estimatedStart = now();
    $estimatedCompletion = now()->addDays($totalProductionDays);
}
```

### How It Works

**Formula**: `progress = (elapsed_time / total_time) × 100`

**Example for Order #2 (50% progress)**:
- Total production time: 14 days
- Target progress: 50%
- Elapsed days needed: (50 / 100) × 14 = 7 days
- Start date: now() - 7 days = Sept 24
- End date: Sept 24 + 14 days = Oct 8
- **Result**: System calculates (7 / 14) × 100 = 50% ✓

### View All Orders with Dates
```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> App\Models\Order::with('items.product')->get()->map(function($o) {
    return [
        'id' => $o->id,
        'placed' => $o->checkout_date->format('M d, Y'),
        'days_ago' => now()->diffInDays($o->checkout_date),
        'product' => $o->items[0]->product->name ?? 'N/A',
        'qty' => $o->items[0]->quantity ?? 0
    ];
});
```

### Check Order Due Dates
```bash
>>> App\Models\Production::all()->map(function($p) {
    $daysUntilDue = now()->diffInDays($p->estimated_completion_date, false);
    return [
        'order' => $p->order_id,
        'progress' => $p->overall_progress . '%',
        'stage' => $p->current_stage,
        'due_in_days' => $daysUntilDue,
        'status' => $daysUntilDue < 0 ? 'OVERDUE' : ($daysUntilDue == 0 ? 'DUE TODAY' : 'ON TRACK')
    ];
});
```

### Find Urgent Orders
```bash
>>> App\Models\Production::whereDate('estimated_completion_date', '<=', now()->addDay())
