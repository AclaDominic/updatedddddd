Demonstrating Order Lifecycle:
  1. Customer places order → Status: PENDING
  2. Admin accepts order → Status: PROCESSING (production starts)
  3. Production completes → Status: READY FOR DELIVERY

1. Creating PENDING order (just placed, awaiting admin acceptance)
   ✓ Order #1 | Dining Table x1
     Order Status: pending | Acceptance: ⏳ PENDING
     🏭 Production: NOT CREATED (order not accepted)
        Will show in production tracking: NO ❌

2. Creating PENDING order (placed 2 days ago, still awaiting acceptance)
   ✓ Order #2 | Wooden Chair x2
     Order Status: pending | Acceptance: ⏳ PENDING
     🏭 Production: NOT CREATED (order not accepted)
        Will show in production tracking: NO ❌

3. Creating PROCESSING order (just accepted today, production starting)
   ✓ Order #3 | Dining Table x1
     Order Status: processing | Acceptance: ✅ ACCEPTED
     🏭 Production: #1 CREATED
        Stage: Material Preparation | Progress: 0%
        Will show in production tracking: YES ✅

... (continues for all 10 orders)

=== Order Status Summary ===
PENDING (2 orders): Orders 1-2 → Awaiting admin acceptance
PROCESSING (7 orders): Orders 3-8, 10 → Production in progress
READY FOR DELIVERY (1 order): Order 9 → Production complete

Customer Orders Page: Shows ALL 10 orders
Production Tracking Page: Shows ONLY 8 orders (3-10, NOT 1-2)

=== Verification ===
Total Orders: 10
Pending Orders: 2 (should be 2)
Accepted Orders: 8 (should be 8)
Total Productions: 8 (should be 8)
✓ No productions for pending orders (correct!)

## 🎯 Why This Is Now Accurate

### Before (Your Problem)
- ❌ Orders 1 & 2 showing in production (wrong - they're pending)
- ❌ Orders 7 & 10 not showing in production (wrong - they're accepted)
- ❌ Old/corrupted data in database

### After (Fixed)
- ✅ Orders 1 & 2 NOT in production (correct - they're pending)
- ✅ Orders 7 & 10 IN production (correct - they're accepted)
- ✅ Fresh, accurate data

## 🔍 How to Verify

### Method 1: Check in Browser
1. Refresh both pages (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Count orders in each page
3. Verify pending orders are hidden from production

### Method 2: Run Verification Script
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=VerifyOrderData
```

Should show:
```
✅ All checks passed!
   - All pending orders have NO production (correct)
   - All accepted orders have production (correct)
```

- **`WHY_YOU_NEED_TO_RUN_CLEANUP.md`** - Visual diagrams
- **`STEP_BY_STEP_FIX.md`** - Detailed instructions

## 🎓 Understanding the Fix

### The Seeder Code (Always Was Correct)
```php
// Order 1 & 2: NOT accepted
'is_accepted' => false  // ← NO production created

// Orders 3-10: Accepted
'is_accepted' => true   // ← Production created
```

### The Controllers (Now Filtered)
```php
// Only show accepted orders in production
->whereHas('order', function($q) {
    $q->where('acceptance_status', 'accepted');
});
```

### The Problem (Old Data)
Your database had old data from previous seeder runs that didn't follow this logic.

### The Solution (Clean + Reseed)
Delete all old data and create fresh, accurate data.
