# Order ID Display Added to Production Page

## Change Made

Added **Order ID** display to the production cards so you can easily identify which order each production belongs to.

## What Was Updated

### Production Page - Current Production Processes Section

**Before:**
```
Dining Table
Qty: 1 â€¢ ID: 1
```

**After:**
```
Dining Table
Qty: 1 â€¢ Prod ID: 1 â€¢ Order #7
```

### Changes in ProductionPage.jsx

**Line 553-558:**
```javascript
<div className="small text-muted">
  Qty: <strong>{prod.quantity || 0}</strong> â€¢ Prod ID: <strong>{prod.id}</strong>
  {prod.order_id && (
    <>
      {' '}â€¢ <span className="text-primary fw-bold">Order #{prod.order_id}</span>
    </>
  )}
  {prod.order?.user?.name && (
    <>
      {' '}â€¢ Customer: <strong>{prod.order.user.name}</strong>
    </>
  )}
</div>
```

## Display Format

Each production card now shows:
- **Product Name**: e.g., "Dining Table"
- **Quantity**: e.g., "Qty: 1"
- **Production ID**: e.g., "Prod ID: 1"
- **Order ID**: e.g., "Order #7" (in blue, bold)
- **Customer Name**: e.g., "Customer: Customer" (if available)

## Example Display

```
9/30/2025                                    In Progress
Dining Table
Qty: 1 â€¢ Prod ID: 5 â€¢ Order #7 â€¢ Customer: Customer

Current Process:
[Sanding & Surface Preparation] [in_progress]
```

## Order ID Mapping

Based on the seeder, here's the mapping:

| Production ID | Order ID | Product | Progress |
|---------------|----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | 3 | Dining Table | 10% |
| 2 | 4 | Wooden Chair | 20% |
| 3 | 5 | Dining Table | 40% |
| 4 | 6 | Wooden Chair | 60% |
| 5 | 7 | Dining Table | 75% |
| 6 | 8 | Wooden Chair | 90% |
| 7 | 9 | Dining Table | 100% |
| 8 | 10 | Alkansya | 30% |

## Benefits

âœ… **Easy Identification**: Quickly see which order a production belongs to
âœ… **Clear Labeling**: "Prod ID" vs "Order #" distinction
âœ… **Visual Emphasis**: Order ID shown in blue and bold
âœ… **Customer Context**: Also shows customer name when available
âœ… **Consistent Display**: Same format in both "Current" and "Ready to Deliver" sections

## Where Order ID Appears

### 1. Current Production Processes Section
- Shows for all in-progress productions
- Displayed in blue, bold text

### 2. Ready to Deliver Section  
- Shows for completed productions
- Helps identify which order to mark as delivered

### 3. Search Functionality
The search box already supports searching by Order ID:
```
Search product, prod ID, order ID, or date
```

## Testing

After refreshing the frontend, you should see:
- âœ… Order #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10 displayed on production cards
- âœ… Order ID in blue, bold text
- âœ… Clear distinction between Production ID and Order ID
- âœ… Customer name also displayed (if available)

## Summary

Now when you see a production card, you'll immediately know:
- **What** is being produced (product name)
- **How much** (quantity)
- **Which production** it is (Prod ID)
- **Which order** it belongs to (Order #) âœ…
- **Who ordered it** (Customer name)

No more confusion about which order a production belongs to! ðŸŽ‰
