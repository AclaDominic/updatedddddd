```

### 2. Top Staff Chart Features

**Display:**
- Bar chart showing completed processes per staff member
- Color-coded bars (brown/wood tones)
- List view below chart with staff names and completion counts
- Shows top 5 staff members

**Data Source:**
- Queries `ProductionProcess` table
- Groups by `completed_by_name`
- Counts completed processes
- Orders by most completed (descending)

### 3. Backend API Updates

**File:** `capstone-back/app/Http/Controllers/ProductionController.php`

**Added to analytics endpoint:**
```php
// Top Staff - Staff members who completed the most processes
$topStaff = ProductionProcess::whereNotNull('completed_by_name')
    ->where('completed_by_name', '!=', '')
    ->where('status', 'completed')
    ->select('completed_by_name', DB::raw('COUNT(*) as completed_processes'))
    ->groupBy('completed_by_name')
    ->orderByDesc('completed_processes')
    ->limit(5)
    ->get()
    ->map(function($staff) {
        return [
            'name' => $staff->completed_by_name,
            'completed_processes' => $staff->completed_processes,
        ];
    })
    ->values();
```

**API Response now includes:**
```json
{
  "kpis": {...},
  "daily_output": [...],
  "stage_breakdown": [...],
  "top_products": [...],
  "top_users": [...],
  "top_staff": [
    {
      "name": "Juan Dela Cruz",
      "completed_processes": 15
    },
    {
      "name": "Maria Santos",
      "completed_processes": 12
    }
  ],
  "resource_allocation": [...],
  "stage_workload": [...]
}
```

### 4. Seeder Updates

**File:** `capstone-back/database/seeders/ComprehensiveOrdersSeeder.php`

**Added Staff Members:**
1. Juan Dela Cruz (juan@unick.com)
2. Maria Santos (maria@unick.com)
3. Pedro Reyes (pedro@unick.com)
4. Ana Garcia (ana@unick.com)
5. Carlos Mendoza (carlos@unick.com)

**All staff members:**
- Role: `employee`
- Password: `password`
- Email verified

**Process Assignment:**
- Each completed process is randomly assigned to one of the 5 staff members
- Creates realistic distribution of work across staff
- Staff names appear in `completed_by_name` field

### 5. Files Modified

**Frontend:**
1. `casptone-front/src/components/Admin/AdminDashboard.js`
   - Removed `StagePieChart` import
   - Added `TopStaffChart` import
   - Moved `DailyOutputChart` to main row (full width)
   - Added `TopStaffChart` to secondary row

2. `casptone-front/src/components/Admin/Analytics/TopStaffChart.jsx` (NEW)
   - Created new component for staff performance visualization
   - Bar chart with Recharts
   - Staff list with completion counts
   - Brown/wood color theme

**Backend:**
3. `capstone-back/app/Http/Controllers/ProductionController.php`
   - Added `top_staff` query to analytics method
   - Returns top 5 staff by completed processes

4. `capstone-back/database/seeders/ComprehensiveOrdersSeeder.php`
   - Added staff member creation
   - Updated `createOrder` method to accept staff array
   - Updated `createProductionProcesses` to randomly assign staff
   - Each completed process gets random staff member

## How to Test

### Step 1: Run the Seeder
```bash
cd capstone-back
php artisan db:seed --class=ComprehensiveOrdersSeeder
```

This will:
- Create 5 staff members (employees)
- Create 9 orders with production tracking
- Assign random staff to completed processes

### Step 2: View Admin Dashboard
1. Login as admin (admin@gmail.com / password)
2. Go to Dashboard
3. You should see:
   - **Daily Output Chart** (full width at top)
   - **Top Staff Performance** (left column, showing staff with most completions)
   - **Top Products** (middle column)
   - **Top Users** (right column, customers)

### Step 3: Verify Staff Data
The Top Staff chart should show:
- Names of staff members (Juan, Maria, Pedro, Ana, Carlos)
- Number of processes each completed
- Bar chart visualization
- List view with completion counts

## Expected Results

### Top Staff Chart Display:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  👥 Top Staff Performance               │
│  Staff members who completed the most   │
│  processes                              │
│                                         │
│  [Bar Chart]                            │
│  Juan Dela Cruz    ████████ 8          │
│  Maria Santos      ██████ 6            │
│  Pedro Reyes       █████ 5             │
│  Ana Garcia        ████ 4              │
│  Carlos Mendoza    ███ 3               │
│                                         │
│  • Juan Dela Cruz      8 completed     │
│  • Maria Santos        6 completed     │
│  • Pedro Reyes         5 completed     │
│  • Ana Garcia          4 completed     │
│  • Carlos Mendoza      3 completed     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Staff Members Created:
- **Juan Dela Cruz** - Employee
- **Maria Santos** - Employee
- **Pedro Reyes** - Employee
- **Ana Garcia** - Employee
- **Carlos Mendoza** - Employee

All can login with their email and password: `password`

## Benefits

1. **Performance Tracking** - See which staff members are most productive
2. **Workload Distribution** - Identify if work is evenly distributed
3. **Recognition** - Highlight top performers
4. **Resource Planning** - Understand staff capacity and utilization
5. **Cleaner Dashboard** - Removed redundant stage breakdown
6. **Better Focus** - Daily output gets more prominence (full width)

## Notes

- Staff assignment is random in the seeder for testing purposes
- In production, actual staff members would complete processes
- The `completed_by_name` field is set when a process is marked as completed
- Staff performance updates in real-time as processes are completed
- Only shows staff who have completed at least one process

## Troubleshooting

### If Top Staff Chart is Empty:
1. Check if seeder ran successfully
2. Verify staff members exist: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = 'employee'`
3. Check if processes have completed_by_name: `SELECT * FROM production_processes WHERE completed_by_name IS NOT NULL`

### If Staff Names Don't Appear:
1. Ensure seeder assigns staff to completed processes
2. Check `completed_by_name` field is populated
3. Verify API returns `top_staff` data: `/api/productions/analytics`

## Summary

✅ **Removed** Production Stage Breakdown (redundant)
✅ **Added** Top Staff Performance chart
✅ **Moved** Daily Output to prominent position (full width)
✅ **Created** 5 staff members in seeder
✅ **Updated** Backend API to provide staff performance data
✅ **Improved** Dashboard layout and focus

The admin dashboard now provides better insights into staff performance and daily production output!
